Also I am thinking along the lines of professional work as well as volunteering to play with/walk/feed/clean the dogs n cats.

This poll is also a word game.
-
I'm trying to figure out which English words actually ARE the thing that they mean. (For example: "word" is a word.) Sometimes a word can be forced into fulfilling this criterion by carefully crafting such a situation. (For example: In its second instance in this sentence, I force the pronoun "itself" to refer to itself.) This, in my opinion, is where the fun is.
-
I'll put all potential candidates I've thought of in the poll options, and I encourage anyone to add any options you can think of. The poll itself will be used to determine which of these candidates are the most legitimate. (For example: "word" is more legitimate than "itself", because "word" always refers to itself, but "itself" only does in certain deliberate constructions.) 
-
If you think a candidate is legit, vote for it. If not, don't. Explanations of how YOU define would legitimacy are welcome, as are explanations of how you corralled a word into a self-referential situation. Candidates must be single words only - no phrases. Have fun!
-
EDIT: I thought of a few more but didn't bother checking their "legitimacy"; see if you can "prove" them and comment your "solutions"!

In this scenario, a robot can replace a person's job. The robots can replace a bunch of these jobs, and the initial impact will cause a little higher price for the product for a couple months but will drop a bit below its initial price forever after those months. If this happens, many many people will lose their jobs because the robots have replaced them and will be out of work for a while.

Hello!
My name is Antonia and i am a Psychology - soon to graduate -student from Romania. For my diploma research, i am conducting a Cross-Cultural study regarding how people cope with stress in relation to their cultural values. From my point of view (and many psychology researchers before me) i believe that everybody is influenced by their cultural environment and therefore people react differently regarding their place of birth and growth. The countries included in my study are Romania, Latvia, United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey.

I would really need your help (if you find yourself from one of these countries or currently living in one) to gather participants for each country. If you think you can answer a few questions (no more than 10 minutes) or if you could share it with your friends and family, trust me, SCIENCE would love it and so will I!

There is a burning building that you were just told was about to collapse. It is your job to go into the building and save lives, you have all the equipment and abilities to do so. Those who escaped the building tell you there is a dog and a person still in there. The dog is on the first floor and the person is on the second floor. Both are injured. Knowing this, you conclude that you only have time to save one life. Saving both will take too long. Who do you save?

Hey guys,

So for my food marketing class this semester I had to come up with a new product related to food. I've decided to create a new company that sells plain chips packaged with flavored powered. What this entails is that you have the option to put as much/little flavor on your chips as possible to go along with your own personal preference. Think of it as those seasonings you can buy for popcorn, but instead this is for chips. If you could take the survey for me that would be awesome.

Hello random group of people. This is a group intended for asking random poll questions with a good distribution of types of ppl for when you're arguing with your friends about something and you wish you could ask a bunch of ppl. Thx 4 the support.

Feel free to make your own polls!! And yes you can INVITE FRIENDS! Ppl have been texting da admins asking if they can invite people but you don't have to ask. In the words of Nike and Shia Labeouf: JUST DO ITTTT.

REQUIREMENTS: no political posts, no inappropriate posts (sexual/violent/you should be able to know what is inappropriate), no spamming. 
Admins can remove these things bc this group is supposed to be fun and great and can start silly fights but shouldn't start real fights ~~~~~~~~
